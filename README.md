# sql-challenge
The goal of the project is to work with data from the 1980s and 1990s and address questions related to employees, their departments, salaries, and managers. The challenge is divided into three main parts:

* Data Modeling: Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the CSV files provided and design the table schema.
* Data Engineering: Create a SQL database, define the table schema for each of the CSV files, import the data into SQL, and set up relationships between tables.
* Data Analysis: Write and execute SQL queries to answer questions related to the employees' information during the given period.

Technologies Used
* PostgreSQL: The database management system used to store and query the employee data.
* pgAdmin: Used for database management and executing SQL queries.
* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Created using QuickDBD to visualize table relationships.
* CSV: Data imported from six CSV files into PostgreSQL tables.
* Git: Version control to track changes and manage the project.
* GitHub: Repository for storing project files and collaboration.
